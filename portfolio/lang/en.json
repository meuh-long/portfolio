Videography, photography, web development and graphic design are the main skills I've acquired, but I've also been able to learn other capabilities, such as accessibility, communication, and SEO.","music":"Music","schub":"Moments musicaux - D.780 op.94, nÂ°3 - Franz Schubert.","schub_desc":"One of Schubert's most famous piano pieces, characterized by its harmonic and melodic simplicity. It inspires me with joy and lightness. When I play it, I imagine a little rabbit, lightly hopping through flower fields.","turina":"Children's Garden op. 63 (I, III, IV, VII) - JoaquÃ­n Turina.","turina_desc":"A suite of pieces by JoaquÃ­n Turina, a Spanish composer, reminding me of childhood in a way, with harmonies typical of Spanish folk music.","accompaniment":"An ChloÃ© - K.524 - W.A. Mozart.","accompaniment_desc":"My first piano accompaniment project, on a Lied by Mozart. Inspired by a poem written by Johann Georg Jacob, it tells the story of love at first sight between him and a girl named ChloÃ©, telling her that only death will separate them.","brahms":"Ballade nÂ°1 op.10 - Johannes Brahms.","brahms_desc":"A powerful piece by Brahms. You can think of it as a sort of medieval battle, at least that's what I imagine when I play it. The pre-war, the war, and the post-war: the realization of the aftermath caused by it.","ghibli":"A Town with an Ocean View - Joe Hisaishi.","ghibli_desc":"For my second piano accompaniment project, I had the chance to perform a piece with an orchestra. It is the music from the movie Kiki's Delivery Service, composed by Joe Hisaishi, a Japanese composer, known especially because he composed original songs for the famous Japanese animation studio Ghibli.","up":"Married Life - Michael Giacchino.","up_desc":"A beautiful piece of movie music...","photo":"Photography","photo1":"Tree with yellow foliage, in autumn.","photo1_desc":"One of the first pictures I took during my MMI studies, as part of a photography class to get us familiar with the equipment. We went out to take pictures within the IUT of AngoulÃªme campus.","photo2":"Young girl with her harp.","photo2_desc":"A picture of a childhood friend, taken for a photography project, which you can find by clicking on the photo. The objective was to take a picture of a subject, an object that corresponds to them, and a location that corresponds to them. I had a lot of fun doing this project, since it was combining two passions I have: photography and writing (poems, in this case), to justify the choices of the photos.","photo3":"This picture is not black and white.","photo3_desc":"Once more taken during a photography class, particularly interesting since it seems to have been put in black and white when you don't pay attention. However, this is not the case and you can see it by looking at the bottom right of the photo, there is a slight yellow color. The magic of our star... (or simply the laws of physics, you tell me)","video":"Videography","video1":"Fake news - The time machine.","video1_desc":"First videography project filmed, directed and edited entirely in the IUT, in groups of 4 students. It's a fake news report made with a humorous tone, presenting two mad \"scientists\" who invented a machine that makes any scientist fantasize... But everything doesn't go as planned, and...","video2":"CinÃ© en Bulle Advertisement","video2_desc":"Animation made on After Effects, promoting the mobile cinema association CinÃ© en Bulle, created from scratch as part of an SAE at the end of the first year in MMI. I also made the background music, recorded on a piano from the conservatoire Gabriel FaurÃ© in AngoulÃªme.","web-dev":"Web Development","web-dev1":"CinÃ© en Bulle","web-dev1_desc":"Website developed as part of a group project for a fictional mobile cinema association, built from scratch as part of an SAÃ‰ at the IUT of AngoulÃªme. It has a WordPress section, accessible by adding /wp/ at the end of the URL, and an admin section to manage contests, posters... Grade received for the site: 17/20","web-dev2":"Ma planÃ¨te au Barbecue","web-dev2_desc":"First static website developed as part of an SAE at the end of the first semester in MMI, evaluated on creating a website to raise awareness about carbon footprint, by giving the equivalent of a trip in barbecue, according to a specific formula. Grade received: 15/20","accessibility":"Accessibility","sbttlt":"Subtitling the beginning of Love Actually.","sbttlt_desc":"This subtitling follows accessibility standards for intra / interlinguistic subtitles.
